# Plot-Modal-Curvature-from-SAP2000-standard-output-file
The script is written in Visual Basic for Excel file. It allows the user to process the displacement from the standard output file of SAP2000 and then upload to a new sheet. Consequently, the curvature of a beam is computed based on the input element length. Finally the curvature is plotted.
